# Followed These Coding Practices
- Casing: kebab-case
- Use BEM syntax for custom CSS classes.
- Use Bootstrap utility classes mainly for layout and spacing, (see the Layout and Utilities sections of the documentation).
- Do not create custom utility classes (see custom Bootstrap variables and what can be overwritten from Bootstrap defaults for other options).
- Use CSS instead of utility classes for reused components. But this doesn't mean you can't use both, consider what will always be the same (CSS) and what may change e.6- spacing around the element (utility classes).
